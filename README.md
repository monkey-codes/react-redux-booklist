## React & Redux tutorial - Booklist App

Basic React & Redux, no ajax or async calls. ActionCreators return
Actions with synchronous payload data.

```
$ npm install
$ npm run start
```
App should be up on http://localhost:8080

Running `guard` in a separate terminal will also do browser livereload when source changes.
